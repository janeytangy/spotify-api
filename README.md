<h1>Spotify Data Visualization <em>(Work In Progress)</em></h1>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this project is to leverage data visualizations of Spotify track audio features to uncover patterns and derive insights essential for anticipating future music trends. 
  Through integration with the Spotify API, I will gather track audio data and process it using Python for analysis. The project seeks to demonstrate proficiency in both data manipulation and interpretation, with a focus on communicating significant findings through compelling visual representations. 
  Ultimately, the aim is to showcase adeptness in handling and analyzing data, complemented by the ability to articulate key insights through engaging visual narratives.

​​<h2>Data Extraction</h2>
<p>
  According to “Spotify for Developers” documentation, the authorization code flow is depicted below.
  I utilized Python to connect to the API and make calls to retrieve track audio features data.
